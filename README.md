# AppMap Issues 

## Overview

This [issues-only](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-an-issues-only-repository) repository tracks open issues for AppMap. This includes all of our agents, plug-ins, and third party integrations. 

## Reporting Issues

Please use the [GitHub new issue form](https://github.com/getappmap/appmap-issues/issues) for reporting any bugs or feature requests.

When it comes to reporting issues or requesting features, more information is better. Anything that will help us understand and effectively replicate issues is good information to include.  

Here are some things you may want to include when you open an issue:

* **A good title.** Be Concise and Descriptive. Help us care.
* **A descriptive overview of the issue.** A clear and detailed explanation of what you were trying to do, and what prevented that from happening.
* **Relevant application frameworks** that you used to create AppMaps (e.g., Ruby on Rails, Django, Spring, etc.)
* **Relevant code editors.** If you use AppMap in a code editor tell us which one. (e.g. VS Code, IntelliJ, PyCharm, etc.)
* **If you used GitHub Actions to create AppMaps, tell us.**
* **Steps we can take to reproduce the issue.**
* **Relevant environment details.** Typical stuff like your OS, special configuration, AppMap versions, etc. If you are using a 3rd party integration (e.g., AppMap for Confluence) let us know.
* **Screenshots or Videos.** As a team we tend to be compelled by visuals.  If possible, add screenshots or videos to demonstrate the issue.
* **Log Files or Error Messages.**
* **Workarounds.** If you have found any temporary solutions or workarounds, please share them.
